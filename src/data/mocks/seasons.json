Co-starring with them is Aqua's girlfriend, Akane Kurokawa, who plays Touki's fiancée, Princess Saya. Due to the fanbase preferring Tsurugi as Touki's love interest, Saya has made fewer and fewer appearances in the manga, making it difficult for Akane to fully immerse herself in the role. Her struggles are compounded by differences between the play's script and the original work—differences that also greatly frustrate Tokyo Blade's author, Abiko Samejima.\n\nAqua, however, is more concerned with his personal goals than he is with the play. He has only one objective in mind: to grow closer to director Toshirou Kindaichi and find out what he knows about Aqua's mother, Ai.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Alisa Mikhailovna \"Alya\" Kujou, the half-Russian and half-Japanese treasurer of the school's student council, is known for her intelligence, stunning looks, and rigid personality. Contrasting her near-flawless persona, Alya's unmotivated classmate Masachika Kuze slacks off during lessons and seems to show no interest in her.\n\nInitially irritated, Alya gradually becomes more intrigued by Masachika and starts expressing her affection for him in Russian. However, she is oblivious to his secret—he understands the language fluently! Due to a childhood friend who was temporarily staying in Japan, Masachika has been studying Russian in hopes of reuniting with her.\n\nAs the two spend more time together, the playful and eccentric relationship between them quickly deepens. In the meantime, both must learn to navigate their new growing feelings for one another.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

            "synopsis": "Torako Koshi is the epitome of perfection. With her peerless beauty, top-notch grades, and position as student council president, her popularity in school is unrivaled. However, she harbors a dark secret—she was a delinquent back in middle school—and this is something she conceals to the best of her abilities.\n\nUnfortunately, when she meets the mysterious deer girl Noko Shikanoko, Torako's hidden shame is constantly on the precipice of being exposed due to Shikanoko's rather weird antics. To maintain the reputation she worked so hard for, Torako must go along with Shikanoko's whims, even going so far as to become president of the newly established Deer Club. All her efforts will be rewarded if she can prevent the menacing doe from accidentally blurting out damaging details about her personal history that will undoubtedly unleash Torako's greatest nightmare.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

            "synopsis": "The 100 Years Quest: a mission so challenging and hazardous that it has remained unaccomplished for over a century. While countless mages have attempted to take on this grueling objective, their results ended in either overwhelming defeat or worse. Nonetheless, Natsu Dragneel and his friends—Lucy Heartfilia, Gray Fullbuster, Erza Scarlet, and Wendy Marvell, along with the exceeds Happy and Charlés—ambitiously embark on the quest.\n\nA year after the Fairy Tail guild has overcome the diabolical forces of Acnologia and Zeref, Natsu and his team trek into the northern continent of Guiltina, where they seek out the employer of the 100 Years Quest and receive their nearly impossible mission: to seal away the Five Dragon Gods—a group of individuals with such vast power that, if left alone, could cause global devastation. Meanwhile, a spirited new member named Touka is recruited to Fairy Tail. Although her vibrant energy and passionate nature makes her perfect for the guild, there seems to be more to her than meets the eye.\n\nDetermined to accomplish their seemingly insurmountable mission, Natsu and his friends begin their treacherous search for the Dragon Gods. However, once encountering a new dark guild named Diabolos, along with the newest recruit of Fairy Tail revealing her true colors, Natsu and his team will find that the 100 Years Quest isn't the only challenge they face. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Unfortunately for them, though the jester manages to escape, the night ends with Harley being captured by a mysterious, katana-wielding woman.\n\nMeanwhile, Amanda Waller, the head of the government security organization A.R.G.U.S., has commandeered a team of supervillains for a ruthless mission into another world. After losing contact with the first suicide squad sent through the portal, Amanda sends Deadshot, Peacemaker, Clayface, King Shark, and Harley as replacements. However, shortly after entering the portal, their helicopter crashes in the middle of a battle between horse-mounted troops and vicious orcs.\n\nWith all of the accompanying A.R.G.U.S. members dead on impact, the villains break free of their shackles and rampage through the army of orcs, unwittingly aiding the human soldiers—only to be rewarded with imprisonment. Now bound by magic-infused shackles, Harley and company must hurry back to the portal they came from, or else the bombs A.R.G.U.S. implanted in their necks will detonate.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

They promise each other not to be too close, not to be too opposing, and to simply keep a vague and comfortable distance, having learned important values about men and women relationships from their parents' previous ones.\n\nSaki, who has worked alone for the sake of her family, doesn't know how to properly rely on others, whereas Yuuta is unsure of how to truly treat her. Standing on fairly equal ground, these two gradually learn the comfort of living together.\n\nTheir relationship progresses from strangers to friends as the days pass. This is a story that may one day lead to love.\n\n(Source: MAL News)",

Not so for melancholic author Osamu Dazai, who would quite literally prefer to drop dead. Video games haven't even been invented yet when he gets yanked into another world in 1948. Really, all the fantastical adventure he keeps running into is just getting in the way of his poetic dream of finding the perfect place to die. But no matter how much he risks his hide, everything seems to keep turning out okay. Follow a miserable hero like no other in this cheerfully bleak isekai comedy!\n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",

Unfortunately for him, skills of this nature are considered useless due to their low success rate, and Touka is thus assigned the title of E-rank hero. Things take a further turn for the worse when Vicius, the goddess who summoned the class, reveals that the lowest-ranked hero will be disposed of so that they do not hinder those with greater talent.\n\nBanished to a notoriously dangerous area, Touka comes face-to-face with death after being cornered by a minotaur-like creature. In a desperate attempt to survive, he uses his supposedly worthless skill—only to quickly realize that it works almost every time. Armed with the ability to render the monsters standing in his way completely helpless, Touka resolves to track down the goddess that tossed him aside and exact his revenge.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

One day, his carefree life is abruptly turned upside down when Takauji Ashikaga brutally seizes power from the Kamakuras, ending their reign. Rescued by a self-proclaimed prophetic priest, Tokiyuki manages to escape with his life. Now he must evade those trying to kill him while recruiting comrades who can help him restore the Kamakura Shogunate to its former glory.\n\nSet during the Nanboku-chou period of Japanese history, Nige Jouzu no Wakagimi is a tale of redemption, documenting the life of the forgotten hero that altered Japan's destiny by running away.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The ensuing conflict will shape the face of the continent for centuries to come...but Noor doesn't have a clue about any of that! Having freshly arrived at the royal capital after over a decade of rigorous, isolated training at his mountain home, he's dead set on achieving his childhood dream of becoming an adventurer, even if the only skills he possesses are useless ones. Sure, he can \"Parry\" thousands of swords in the span of a single breath, but everybody knows you need more than that if you want to be an adventurer! Our hero's road to making his dream come true will be long(?) and arduous(?)—but if there's one thing Noor's not afraid of, it's some good ol' fashioned hard work!\n\n(Source: J-Novel Club)",

He's your typical otaku, obsessed with a sexy (fictional) 2D manga character known as Lilliel. Then the new school year starts, and a (real!) 3D girl named Ririsa whose passion is cosplay joins the club. Ririsa convinces Okumura to become her photographer—and guess who her favorite manga character is? Not only that, but Ririsa is into modeling the fetishy stuff! The boundaries between 2D and 3D start to blur as this hot-blooded romantic comedy unfolds.\n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",

Coupled with his innate talent in magical arts, this upbringing allows Ike to quickly rise in the Demon Lord's army ranks, leading his brigade to consecutive victories against humans.\n\nHowever, Ike has a secret—he is a human himself. Despite knowing all too well the consequences if this information is ever to leak, Ike is willing to face such immense danger to achieve his goal: find a way for humans and demons to coexist and stop the war that has been carried on for far too long.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But this man, Rick Gladiator, who became an adventurer when he was over thirty years old, had the combat power of an S-rank adventurer, the highest rank in the world. In fact, Rick has lived an unimaginable life with the members of the legendary Orihalcon Fist, a party of the continent's strongest adventurers. From dragons to vampires, Rick's fighting prowess, trained by his literal \"monster\" mentors, allows him to defeat elite adventurers one after another who try to underestimate him. \n\n(Source: MU)",

            "synopsis": "In a time when the great war between five rival races for supremacy on Earth ended with humanity's victory led by the hero Sid, the world suddenly gets \"overwritten\" right before the eyes of a boy named Kai. In this rewritten world, Kai witnesses humanity's defeat in the war as a result of Sid's absence—where dragons and demons now rule the land, and Kai himself has become a forgotten existence to all humans. However, after encountering the mysterious girl Rinne, Kai resolves to break free from this rewritten fate. In a world without a hero, he inherits the sword and martial skills of the hero (Sid) and challenges the powerful enemy races that dominate the land.\n\n(Source: MAL News)",

But now Araragi has departed for university, leaving his friends to fend for themselves against new problems and curses that plague them. Yotsugi Ononoki, once a human corpse and now a living doll, takes residence in Araragi's home, keeping watch over his sister Tsukihi, a girl harboring a mystical secret of her own. As part of her duties, Yotsugi fills Araragi's vacated role as occult expert, assisting others in town with their issues.\n\nOne of these girls, middle school student Nadeko Sengoku, slowly recovers from her own recent brushes with the paranormal. She avoids returning to school, instead spending time alone in her room and pursuing her dream of becoming a professional manga artist. In order to speed up Nadeko's quest for mastery of her craft, Yotsugi convinces her to create four copies of herself, each representing a distinct aspect of Nadeko's personality. However, the clones refuse to help Nadeko, instead escaping into the town and creating a chaotic mess. Now forced to grapple with her own fractured sense of identity, Nadeko sets out to capture them and resolve her inner conflict.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

First-year student Saki Aoi is no exception, and she falls in love with Makoto at first sight. Having a vibrant and vigorous personality, she does not hesitate to confess her feelings to her senior. However, Makoto differs significantly from the person Saki perceives: Makoto is not a girl, but rather a cross-dressing boy!\n\nAfter revealing his well-known secret to Saki, Makoto expects her to be disgusted. Surprisingly, she is instead captivated by this revelation. Nonetheless, he still rejects her, but Saki's determination does not stop her from declaring that she will become his first love. With Saki and his childhood friend at his side, Makoto's world brightens, giving him strength amid his struggle between his interests and the expectations placed on him.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
